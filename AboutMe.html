    My Portfolio is more than just the work that I've done and programming. 
    As you can tell by the theme of my webpage, I am a proud Harry Potter fan 
    reading all 7 books, and proudly placed into the ravenclaw house from the 
    pottermore placement quiz :). Not only am I a code geek but I am also a gym
    rat, I work out 2-3 times a week to maintain my healthy physic. I also enjoy
    listening to music, dancing, and also play a bit of video games. <br><br>

    What inspired me to choose the software development career?: <br><br> 

    Beginning at 9 years old, I've been doing web developement since elementary school. 
    3rd grade was my beginning stage of having my own social media account and email 
    account; Before facebook, our social media pages were either livejournal or xanga, and 
    basically the fad was to have the most stand out profile in either xanga/livejournal, 
    I would sometimes spend countless hours on working my xanga profile; fondling with html,
    css, and javascript code. One of the first ever applications I have ever wrote was an 
    error handling application that would prevent users from right clicking on my profile. 
    Fondling with code always fascinated me, and I got hooked ever since I wrote my first ever 
    application. <br><br>
