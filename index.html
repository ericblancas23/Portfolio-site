<center> <p id="aboutMe"> Welcome! I'm Eric Blancas and this is my personal Portfolio which consists of
    my personal projects and also my school projects that I have done over
    the years. I am a self-taught programmer that is attending csu channel islands 
    as a computer science major. Being a developer that is both self-taught and attending
    college has taught me a number of things such as being a team player in projects, 
    problem solving/critical thinking, intercommunication skills and theory. I am quick learning,
    hard working, and optimistic individual who is devoted to creating software both during work 
    and also free time. Feel free to take a look at my work that I have put my time into, and contact
    info is available.  <br><br>
